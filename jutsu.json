It is accomplished by using chakra to temporarily vitalize the body and move at extreme speeds. The amount of chakra required depends on the overall distance and elevation between the user and the intended destination. A puff of smoke is occasionally used to disguise the user's movements. Other elements or substances can be used instead to distract the opponent."

The weight and power of the hands are greatly increased because of the larger size, the muscles are activated with concentrated chakra, and the thickness is also increased. With so much chakra that it becomes visible, the user's palms become like an iron hammer. This gives this attack the power to even cave in the earth, causing extensive crushing damage to anything that may be caught beneath them.

Because the members of the Akimichi clan tend to be overweight to support their techniques, this pill can give them 100 times their normal chakra level. The intensely concentrated chakra that is gained leaks out from the backbone and becomes visible through friction with the shoulder blade, appearing like a butterfly wing. The user then concentrates the unique chakra into their fist, and then puts all their body weight behind the punch. The massive amount of chakra concentrated is enough to change the user's body structure, and the user will die unless given medical attention as described in the medical encyclopedia from the Nara clan soon thereafter. Should an Akimichi be able to use the Calorie Control and enter a unique state, they can bypass the danger posed by the pills."

However the clones are not perfect copies, the clones made start at 50% of the users strength and that gets split across the total amount of clones made meaning if you make 5 clones they are each at 10% of the user's strength. Another Difference is that these clones each can only take 1-2 hits before being dispursed, all of the knowledge gained and a portion of their remaining chakra are sent back to the user. This can allow the technique to be used to expedite training, but just like reserves and knowledge are transferred so to is the exhaustion."

The technique is so complicated that users generally require aid from clones in order to perform the technique, though they can master it enough to do so without assistance. Rasenshuriken require a great deal of chakra to perform and, once formed, the Rasenshuriken gives off a loud screeching noise. Its four points are very sharp, enough to cut through rock and even a Bijuu's tail. After traveling a certain distance or colliding with a target that it can't slice through, the central sphere of the Rasenshuriken detonates, producing a vortex of wind in the immediate area. Within this vortex, countless microscopic wind blades are created, so many that even the Sharingan can't count them all. The wind blades damage anything within the vortex on a cellular level, attacking the chakra circulatory system to such a degree that no amount of medical ninjutsu can heal it. Most Medical ninja likens the damage to poison, and warns that if the damage is great enough, those affected by it won't be able to use jutsu again. Requires Rasengan"

Once trapped the target is unable to move or breathe while within it due to the heaviness of the water. Because of the density of the water it can be used, to a limited extent, for defensive purposes if performed on oneself. It can also be stored in scrolls as traps.

When used on the dead, the user will find a certain death in exchange for the soul of the deceased. While in use, the released chakra shines a pale-blue color, and if the user’s own chakra is insufficient, a third party can assist but only the actual user of the jutsu will die. Due to humane motives, this has been labeled a kinjutsu and thus, very few can use it."

It is also a defensive maneuver to compensate for the Byakugan's blind spot as the released chakra blocks any possible attack on the user. After releasing chakra from every tenketsu in their body, the user then spins rapidly to parry the attack, both creating a rotating shield of chakra around themselves and tossing away any nearby attackers. The user can also actively control the size and power of the sphere to suit the situation. The technique is also capable of reflecting an opponent's chakra against them. Scales to A Rank."

While using this technique offensively, The user shapes the chakra into thin, sharp, flexible blades allowing them to hit hundreds of targets with extreme precision and can cut smaller targets, like bees, into pieces. When used defensively, The user creates much larger, stronger, more flexible, arc-shaped chakra blades that spread out across their entire attack range, effectively forming a barricade between themselves and their opponents, rebuffing even the largest and smallest of targets. With the addition of the user's flexibility, the technique creates an absolute defense effect similar to that of the Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven, though the cutting nature of the chakra prevents any outside force from restricting it."

The final form, Perfect Susanoo, is a full body of chakra capable of fighting Tailed Beasts while being just as big as they are. This form can also fly as it can generate wings. While the form is stronger, faster, and more durable than its previous counterpart, it can still be damaged and destroyed by sufficient power. The higher stages of Susanoo consume more chakra than the previous stages, but even the lower stages still consume a lot of chakra and as such this limits the duration one can sustain the technique."

The user changes chakra inside their body into a powerful acidic fluid that will melt anything and spits out the viscous fluid from her mouth. Both the shape and the amount are determined by her. By spitting it out at short-range the technique's speed increases. By distributing the liquid across a vast range, they create an acid wall. Anything that touches it will crumble and lose its shape. Should the initial attack miss, a great deal of smoke is created by the effects of the acid, so a follow-up attack can be conducted while the enemy's vision remains obscured. It can even melt chakra-based defenses such as the Susanoo."

This ability can also be manipulated in order to restrict the intended target's movements, as after the initial blast the remnants of the substance can act in a similar manner to quick-drying cement. However, the technique requires the addition of water to set off the necessary reaction to make the substance harden. This can be easily achieved through the use of a Water Release technique, which can also serve to increase the area covered by the substance, thus further increasing the potential range of the technique."

Isolated from the outside world by a barrier, the dimension sealed inside the Gourd Toad's stomach is far larger than the size of the Gourd Toad itself. Even if at a moment's notice, only the technique's caster can freely enter and exit the isolated space. Should the need arise, the toad can be used to transport whatever it has captured, releasing its contents when given the command. The environment inside the toad's stomach is a cavernous chamber, which includes a lake of strong corrosive gastric acid that can dissolve anything that should happen to fall into it, along with shores around the acid lake, and rock formations sticking out of the lake; the already-existing structures within the Toad's stomach are seemingly unaffected by the acid lake.

The oesophagus is ordinarily inescapable, and over time it will contract around and digest its victims.The user can control the oesophagus, causing it to expand, contract, or grow in whatever direction they wish. The toads stomach is also fire resistant in most situations and nearly inescapable. If proficient, one can demonstrate the ability to summon a giant toad's stomach using this technique. This section of the toad contains stomach acid, and the air within is filled with an acidic poison that is colourless and odourless, making it difficult to detect.

Though they primarily use two blades grown from the palms of their hands, he also uses several secondary bones grown from their elbows, knees, and shoulders. This dance form is incredibly acrobatic, using spins, charges, and long sweeping slashes to make the strikes more effective and to evade opponents' counter strikes. Users can also extend his bones to attack his opponents without having to adjust their own movement."

They then stabs chaotically and continuously which causes the opponents eyes to lag behind. The speed resembles afterimages, the hand with the sword is again and again visibly projected. And yet the movement is irregular which makes it difficult to predict. With each thrust the sword's track is very capable of changing. The attack comes from unexpected angles, causing a person's delicate defense reaction to come off guard. Though one can have great reflexes and moving ability, it is next to impossible to keep dodging the fierce attack until it stops. Thus if one showed an opening, a finishing blow will be dealt by one stab in an instant."

While this gate is active the user experiences an additional X1 increase to their strength and endurance, and can use Sekizo and Night Guy."

Minor fractures can be mended as well if the user remains stationary, but compound ones and other more major, potentially lethal injuries will require proper medical attention. The most the technique can do against such heavy damage is improve chances of survival, if it can be upheld; further activations (4-7) can not boost the body's recovery rate any higher. Due to this quickened recovery rate, the user can now reach 100% of their physical potential, but only in brief, sporadic spurts.

This new density of power gives rise to a lesser passive version of the prior focusing techniques, the ongoing breeze shrouding the body not only capable of somewhat hindering strikes and redirecting projectiles, but also slightly expediting the user's attacks for greater impact. The actual focusing techniques can still be used and at far greater potency too, the offensive one in particular as it may also opt for a cutting force instead of an explosive one due to the auras windy nature, though as one might guess from the imperfections they remain as taxing to perform as before. A final outwardly invisible effect is improving the brain's perception of time; the user views the world in slight slow-motion akin to a massive adrenaline overload, but due to lack of sharingan-like foresight it is still up to him/her to respond in time. If the user overwhelms the granted recovery rate of the method with over-usage, besides the usual muscle/bone damage one may also experience painful breath from exhausted lungs and fractured ribs, extreme lightheadedness, even patches of skin littered in bleeding cuts if not peeled away altogether."

        "jutsuDescription": "The seventh activation is the final breath, set apart from the others even by its activation. While still enhanced by the sixth breath, the user strikes two specific pressure points near the lungs simultaneously, triggering a chain reaction that stimulates every tenketsu in the body. This enhances the chakra network's activity to the point it draws the aura's outwardly radiating power within the body completely, which when coupled with a last lungful of air elevates the body to super human levels; a state known as Zentai Kaigan [full body awakening]. The aura now reforms with deadly calm and absence of outbursts, wreathed around the user as if they were a furious wind elemental due to their blazing eyes and steaming flesh still visible beneath the shroud. Besides contributing to their monstrous speed and power, it turns throwing weapons largely useless as most are simply blown spinning away, melee hits no easier to land due to the brains improved ability to view the world in slow-motion. Focusing techniques even more potent as well even if no easier to perform, with the option for even higher form of offense available; by releasing a large portion of the aura shroud during a punch or sufficiently straight kick, a blast akin to a highly concentrated horizontal hurricane is fired. A method of destruction never named, for anyone who faced the devastating air cannon comparable to 'Evening Elephant' of the inner gates is typically left hoping to never encounter it again. Unsurprisingly this incurs a significantly higher cost, not only weakening the aura considerably for a time but also draining so much power 3-5 uses will use up anyone's supply, forcing the user back to base state if every bone in their arm breaking from such rapid multi-usage did not give them pause first. Lastly, significantly skilled users may utilize the shroud to slow their fall or temporarily halt it entirely; coupled with high leaps and bursts of air for directional change, a measure of flight is attained [not as free-form nor sustainable as the Light-weight rock technique however]. Despite everything, the final breath always comes with inevitable consequences, with even shorter usages causing severe dizziness if not loss of consciousness, large areas of skin littered in cuts and gashes if not peeled away or burnt from friction. Majority of the rib cage is also bound to fracture if not shatter, along with any number of bones overwhelmed by ones own strength. Needless to say the final breath should never be attempted twice without a period of significant recovery in between, or it will kill you once it's duration has expired."

When a clone is hit, it will merely turn back into sheets of paper. If need be, the user can conceal explosive tags within their paper clones to allow for a deadly surprise attack."

        "jutsuDescription": "The user disguises six hundred billion explosive tags as the surrounding scenery, be it earth or water, with enough sophistication that even the Sharingan cannot see through it. When the target is in position, the user causes the scenery to split in half, resulting in the rapid creation of a huge abyss beneath the target. Due to the sudden lack of any available foothold, the target inevitably descends ever deeper into the depths of the chasm. As the target falls, the user guides the explosive tags to stick to their body and detonate, with six hundred billion being enough for ten minutes of consecutive explosions."
